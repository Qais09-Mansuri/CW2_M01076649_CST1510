    "During the first five weeks, my learning journey has been both challenging and rewarding. I've gained new skills, explored fresh ideas, and developed more confidence in applying what I've learned. I particularly enjoyed [mathematic tasks, and input tasks], though I found [mathematic and file inserting] difficult at first. Overall, this experience has helped me grow and stay motivated to keep improving."
